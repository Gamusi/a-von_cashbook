## Overview

**A-Von CashBook** is a proprietary offline-first desktop application designed to streamline financial management for Ugandan educational institutions.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Desktop Shell | Tauri |
| Backend | Python 3.11+ / FastAPI |
| Database | SQLite via SQLAlchemy |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| PDF Generation | ReportLab |
| Excel Import | openpyxl |
| IPC | Tauri sidecar (localhost FastAPI) |

### Frontend

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop Shell | Tauri | Native window, system tray, print dialog, file system access |
| UI Framework | React 18 | Component tree, state management |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast dev server and production bundler |
| Styling | TailwindCSS | Utility-first styling |
| Routing | React Router v6 | Client-side navigation |
| State | Zustand | Lightweight global state (auth, active term, institution) |
| API Client | Axios | HTTP calls to FastAPI backend |
| Forms | React Hook Form | Form state and validation |
| Tables | TanStack Table | Sortable, filterable data tables |
| Date Handling | date-fns | Date formatting and arithmetic |
| PDF Trigger | Tauri shell API | Opens system print dialog on backend-generated PDFs |
| Icons | Lucide React | Consistent icon set |
| Notifications | React Hot Toast | Non-blocking feedback toasts |

**Shell architecture:** React runs inside the Tauri window. The Python FastAPI backend runs as a sidecar process connecting over a local loopback. Tauri handles OS-level operations; React handles all UI; Python handles all data and business logic.

**Fonts (bundled, no CDN):** `Geist` (body text) · `Syne` (headings & display) · `JetBrains Mono` (receipt numbers, amounts, IDs)

**Theme:** Light and dark mode from day one via CSS custom properties (`[data-theme]`). OS preference respected on first launch; persisted via Tauri.

**Light palette:** `--color-primary: #1B4F72` · `--color-accent: #1A7A4A` · `--color-surface: #FFFFFF` · `--color-background: #F4F6F9`

**Dark palette:** `--color-primary: #2E86C1` · `--color-accent: #27AE60` · `--color-surface: #1A2235` · `--color-background: #0F1623`
