# A-Von CashBook — Frontend Architecture and Design Reference

**Project:** A-Von CashBook  
**Maintained by:** A-Von Computer Solutions  
**Stack:** React + TailwindCSS + Vite inside Tauri desktop shell  
**For:** Frontend Developer reference — complete Phase 1 scope  

---

## How to Use This Document

This is the frontend equivalent of the backend architecture reference. Every screen, every component, every API connection, and every design decision has a place here. Build against this document. When you are unsure where a screen belongs or what data it consumes, come here first.

The frontend connects to the backend via `http://localhost:{PORT}/api/v1/`. During development, use mock data shaped exactly like the real API responses. When the backend is ready, swap the mock for real calls — the shape never changes.

---

## Development Context

The frontend is being developed in parallel by A-Von Computer Solutions, using mock data while the trainee builds the backend. The two will be integrated once the backend reaches Tier 4 and Tier 5 of the training curriculum.

This parallel approach is intentional. The frontend is built against agreed API contract shapes defined in this document. The backend is built to fulfill those same shapes. Integration is a connection step, not a redesign.

**Screen build order:**
1. Authentication (Login)
2. Dashboard
3. Remaining screens sequenced as development progresses

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop Shell | Tauri | Native window, system tray, print dialog, file system access |
| UI Framework | React 18 | Component tree, state management |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast dev server and production bundler |
| Styling | TailwindCSS | Utility-first styling |
| Routing | React Router v6 | Client-side navigation |
| State | Zustand | Lightweight global state (auth, active term, institution) |
| API Client | Axios | HTTP calls to FastAPI backend |
| Forms | React Hook Form | Form state and validation |
| Tables | TanStack Table | Sortable, filterable data tables |
| Date Handling | date-fns | Date formatting and arithmetic |
| PDF Trigger | Tauri shell API | Opens system print dialog on backend-generated PDFs |
| Icons | Lucide React | Consistent icon set |
| Notifications | React Hot Toast | Non-blocking feedback toasts |

**Shell architecture:** The React frontend runs inside the Tauri window. The Python FastAPI backend runs as a sidecar process and connects over a local loopback connection. Tauri handles OS-level operations — file dialogs, print dialogs, system tray. React handles all UI. Python handles all data and business logic.

## Design System

### Philosophy

The app is used by bursars and headteachers in Ugandan schools. Many users are not highly technical. The interface must be clean, clear, and forgiving of mistakes. Speed matters — a bursar recording payments during a busy morning does not have time for confusion.

The visual language is professional and trustworthy, not flashy. It should feel like a well-designed banking app, not a startup SaaS product. Every element earns its place.

---



### Theming

Both light and dark mode are fully supported from the start. No dark-only or light-only shortcuts. Every component and color token is designed to render correctly in both modes.

Theming is implemented via CSS custom properties scoped to `[data-theme="light"]` and `[data-theme="dark"]`. The theme toggle writes to a Zustand store and persists to a local config file via Tauri. The app respects the OS system preference on first launch.

Component tokens — surface colors, text colors, border colors, shadow intensities — are all defined as CSS variables. Never hardcode a color that would look wrong in the other mode.

**Light mode palette:**
```
--color-primary:        #1B4F72
--color-primary-light:  #2E86C1
--color-accent:         #1A7A4A
--color-warning:        #B7770D
--color-danger:         #922B21
--color-surface:        #FFFFFF
--color-background:     #F4F6F9
--color-border:         #DDE1E7
--color-text-primary:   #1C2833
--color-text-muted:     #6B7280
```

**Dark mode palette:**
```
--color-primary:        #2E86C1
--color-primary-light:  #5DADE2
--color-accent:         #27AE60
--color-warning:        #F0B429
--color-danger:         #E74C3C
--color-surface:        #1A2235
--color-background:     #0F1623
--color-border:         #1E2D45
--color-text-primary:   #E2E8F0
--color-text-muted:     #64748B
```

---

### Typography

Three fonts are used across the application. All are loaded locally — bundled with the app, never fetched from a CDN at runtime.

**Geist** — primary UI font. Used for body text, labels, inputs, table content, and all general interface copy. Weights 400 and 500.

**Syne** — display and heading font. Used for page titles, section headers, the app title, and any prominent UI element that needs visual weight. Weight 700 and 800. The app title "A-Von CashBook" uses Syne 800 with `letter-spacing: -0.5px` — the "CashBook" portion rendered in the primary accent color.

**JetBrains Mono** — monospace font. Used for receipt numbers, student IDs, monetary amounts in tables, and any technical or code-style data.

Font size scale:
- xs: 11px — labels, badges, table metadata
- sm: 13px — table body, secondary text
- base: 14px — default body text
- md: 16px — section headings, form labels
- lg: 20px — page titles
- xl: 24px — dashboard stat numbers
- 2xl: 32px — large KPI figures

App title implementation reference:
```jsx
<h1 className="font-extrabold tracking-tight" style={{ fontFamily: 'Syne' }}>
  A-Von <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary-light)' }}>CashBook</span>
</h1>
```

---

### Spacing

Use Tailwind's default spacing scale. Maintain consistent padding:
- Page outer padding: `px-6 py-5`
- Card inner padding: `p-5`
- Form field gap: `gap-4`
- Section gap: `gap-6`
- Table row height: minimum `h-11`

---

### Status Badges

Used consistently across payments, expenses, students, and terms.

| Status | Color | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Fully Paid | Green | Payment complete |
| Partial | Amber | Partial payment recorded |
| Unpaid | Red | No payment made |
| Voided | Gray | Voided payment |
| Active | Green | Student enrollment |
| Transferred | Blue | Student transferred |
| Dropout | Orange | Student dropped out |
| Graduate | Purple | Student graduated |
| Draft | Gray | Expense not submitted |
| Pending | Amber | Awaiting approval |
| Approved | Blue | Expense approved |
| Paid | Green | Expense paid |
| Rejected | Red | Expense rejected |
| Open | Green | Term open |
| Closed | Gray | Term closed |
| Frozen | Blue | Term frozen |

---

## Application Layout

### AppShell

The persistent shell wrapping every authenticated screen. Contains:

**Sidebar (left, fixed width 240px):**
- School logo and name at the top
- Navigation items grouped by module (see Navigation Structure below)
- Active term indicator at the bottom of the sidebar showing term label and status
- Current logged-in user name and role
- Logout button

**Topbar (top, full width):**
- Current page title
- Active academic year and term (e.g. "2025 — Term 1")
- Global search bar (searches students by name or ID)
- Notification area (pending expense approvals visible to headteacher)

**Main content area:**
- `PageHeader` component at the top of every page (title + primary action button)
- Scrollable content below

---

### Navigation Structure

Sidebar items are role-controlled. Items the current user cannot access are hidden entirely, not just disabled.

Current database file path shown. Last backup date and file. Create Backup button — opens file save dialog via Tauri. Passphrase field for encryption (optional but shown as strongly recommended). Backup log table: date, filename, created by.

**Restore section:**
Warning banner explaining restore will overwrite current data. Upload encrypted backup file. Passphrase field. Confirm Restore button with double confirmation dialog.

---

### Audit Log (Super Admin + Headteacher)

**Filters:** Date range | User | Action type | Table name | Search by record ID

**Table columns:** Timestamp | User | Action | Table | Record ID | Summary of Change

Expandable rows: click any row to see full old value and new value as formatted JSON diff.

No export or print in Phase 1. Read-only, always.

## API Contract — How Frontend Calls Backend

All API calls go through the `useApi` hook which handles:
- Base URL injection from config
- Session token attachment on every request
- 401 interception → auto logout and redirect to login
- Error normalization → toast notification on 4xx/5xx
- Loading state management

Each file in `frontend/src/api/` exports named async functions. Example pattern:

```javascript
// frontend/src/api/payments.js

export const recordPayment = (payload) =>
  api.post('/payments', payload)

export const getStudentBalance = (studentId) =>
  api.get(`/students/${studentId}/balance`)

export const voidPayment = (paymentId, reason) =>
  api.put(`/payments/${paymentId}/void`, { reason })

export const getPaymentHistory = (filters) =>
  api.get('/payments', { params: filters })
```

During development before the backend is ready, these functions return mock data shaped identically to what the real backend will return. The mock/real switch is a single config flag in `useApi`.

## Mock Data Shapes (Development Reference)

These are the shapes the frontend depends on. The backend must return data in exactly these structures.

**Student (from GET /students/{id}):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "student_id": "AVN-2025-001",
  "first_name": "Amara",
  "last_name": "Osei",
  "class_id": 3,
  "class_name": "P.6",
  "guardian_name": "Kofi Osei",
  "guardian_phone": "0772000000",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2025-01-10T08:00:00"
}
```

**Student Balance (from GET /students/{id}/balance):**
```json
{
  "student_id": 1,
  "term_id": 2,
  "term_label": "Term 1 2025",
  "total_due": 750000,
  "total_paid": 300000,
  "outstanding": 450000,
  "breakdown": [
    { "fee_category": "Tuition", "due": 500000, "paid": 300000, "balance": 200000 },
    { "fee_category": "PTA", "due": 50000, "paid": 0, "balance": 50000 },
    { "fee_category": "Development", "due": 200000, "paid": 0, "balance": 200000 }
  ]
}
```

**Payment (from POST /payments — response):**
```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "receipt_number": "2025/T1/0042",
  "student_id": 1,
  "student_name": "Amara Osei",
  "class_name": "P.6",
  "amount": 300000,
  "channel": "cash",
  "channel_reference": null,
  "payment_date": "2025-03-10",
  "recorded_by_name": "Sarah Nakato",
  "is_voided": false,
  "allocations": [
    { "fee_category": "Tuition", "amount_allocated": 300000 }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-03-10T09:15:00"
}
```

**Expense (from GET /expenses/{id}):**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "description": "Chalk and markers for classrooms",
  "category": "Stationery",
  "payee": "Mukwano Supplies",
  "amount": 85000,
  "document_reference": "INV-2025-0089",
  "status": "pending_approval",
  "initiated_by_name": "Sarah Nakato",
  "initiated_at": "2025-03-09T14:00:00",
  "approved_by_name": null,
  "approved_at": null
}
```

**Cashbook Entry (from GET /cashbook):**
```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "entry_type": "receipt",
  "description": "Payment — Amara Osei — Receipt 2025/T1/0042",
  "debit": 300000,
  "credit": 0,
  "balance": 4250000,
  "entry_date": "2025-03-10",
  "reference_id": 42,
  "reference_table": "payments"
}
```

## Role-Based UI Rules

These rules are enforced in the frontend with the `RoleGuard` component and `useAuth` hook. They mirror the backend permissions exactly.

| UI Element | Super Admin | Headteacher | Bursar | Data Entry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Collect Payment button | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Void Payment button | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Approve Expense button | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Add/Edit Student | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| User Management menu | Yes | No | No | No |
| Audit Log menu | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Reports menu | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Cashbook menu | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Backup menu | Yes | No | No | No |
| Academic Structure settings | Yes | No | No | No |

---

## UX Principles

**Speed over completeness.** The bursar's primary screen is Payment Collection. It must be reachable in one click from anywhere. The student search must return results instantly.

**Confirm before consequence.** Any destructive or irreversible action — void, delete, freeze term, restore backup — requires a confirmation dialog with a clear description of what will happen.

**Always show context.** The active term and academic year must be visible at all times in the topbar. The bursar must never wonder which term they are recording a payment in.

**Fail visibly, not silently.** API errors must produce a visible toast with a human-readable message. Never fail silently. Never show a blank screen on error.

**Offline means offline.** The app must function fully with no internet connection. All API calls go to localhost. No CDN resources at runtime — all fonts and icons are bundled.

**Print is first-class.** Receipts, vouchers, and reports must print cleanly on A4. The print button is always accessible on screens where printing is relevant.

**Numbers are formatted.** All monetary amounts are displayed as `UGX X,XXX,XXX` using Ugandan format. Never show raw numbers without formatting.

**Dates are human.** Show dates as `10 Mar 2025`, not `2025-03-10`. Timestamps as `10 Mar 2025, 9:15 AM`.

## Phase 2 Deferred Items

These are not built in Phase 1 but the frontend architecture must not make them impossible to add:

- SMS notification triggers from payment collection screen
- Mobile money API confirmation flow in payment channel section
- Online backup option in Backup screen
- Parent/guardian portal view
- Multi-branch selector in topbar
- Health facility module (separate module folder added when ready)
