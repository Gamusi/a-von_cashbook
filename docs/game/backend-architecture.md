## How to Use This Document

This is your north star for the entire backend. Every file you create, every table you design, every endpoint you build has a place in this document. When you are unsure where something belongs or what it should be named, come here first.

You will not build everything at once. You will build it module by module, task by task. But knowing the full picture from the start means every decision you make is intentional, not accidental.

## Data Flow — How the Pieces Connect

```
Institution Setup (one time)
        |
Academic Year created
        |
Term opened → receipt counter initialized at 0001
        |
Classes created → linked to academic year
        |
Students enrolled → linked to class
        |
Fee Categories defined (user-defined)
        |
Fee Structures set → class + term + category + amount
        |
Optional: Payment Plans per student per term
Optional: Fee Adjustments per student (bursary/discount)
        |
Bursar opens Payment Collection
        |
Payment recorded → receipt number generated (YYYY/T#/NNNN)
        |
Payment Allocations created → splits amount across fee categories
        |
Cashbook Entry auto-created (debit)
        |
Receipt PDF generated and printed
        |
Bank Deposit recorded → Cashbook Entry auto-created
        |
Expense initiated → submitted → approved → paid
        |
Expense Cashbook Entry auto-created (credit)
        |
Reports generated from cashbook + payments + expenses
        |
Term closed → balances frozen → carry-forward calculated
        |
Every action above → Audit Log entry written
```

## Rules You Must Never Break in Code

These are not suggestions. They are enforced by the business logic.

- Receipt numbers are never reused. Never editable. Generated atomically.
- Cashbook entries are never manually created, updated, or deleted. They are always the result of another action.
- The audit log is append-only. No service ever updates or deletes an audit entry.
- Voided payments remain in the database. They appear in the cashbook as reversal entries.
- Closing a term freezes all its transactions. No payments or expenses can be recorded against a frozen or closed term.
- A student soft-deleted (status changed) is never hard-deleted. Their history is permanent.
- Passwords are always stored hashed. Never plain text. Never logged.
